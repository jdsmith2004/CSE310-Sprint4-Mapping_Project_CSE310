# Overview
The goal of this sign in page was to create a an interactive map showing major tectonic activity and the specific locations.

This software system allows a user to access a world map and go through to view different plate activity with image overlays.

I wrote this as a fun interactive map used to interact with and view tectonic plate activity.
